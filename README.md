# OHBM2020-stuttering
Code for the abstract submitted to OHBM 2020 in Montreal (virtual due to COVID-19).

**6/24/20** Repo is a work in progress. Analysis code is in `code/` folder. The saved matlab workspace (OHBM.mat) is too large to host on Github (2GB). You can download it here: https://umich.box.com/s/vt944l660je6dv9jhq0lxpin5lz8nz4u 
All analysis was run using MATLAB R2015b.
